  * Linux and Mac user can use the command line git client
  * Recommended clients for Windows are [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) or [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)

## Installation
* Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)  (Python 3.7 version)
* Launch a terminal (or the `Anaconda Prompt` on Windows)

* Go to the repository directory
* Update the environment with:
```
conda env update -f environment.yml
```

## Usage
* To run the web application locally, you need to execute the file `__init__.py` with your `python` executable.
    * Launch a terminal
    * Execute the file (from project root):
        * On Unix:
        ```
        python web/__init__.py
        ```
        * On Windows:
        ```
        :: Depending or your python version
        python web\__init__.py
        :: or
        python3 web\__init__.py
        ```
    * In the folder `web` is the file `config.py`. From it, easily configure the application and daemon cleaner.
    * Access the application by opening your browser of choice at the address and port in `config.py` (ex: [127.0.0.1:5000](127.0.0.1:5000) or [localhost:5000](localhost:5000))
