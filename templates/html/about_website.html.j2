    <p>
        The objective of this website is to better understand the topology
        of fibers at their points of intersection in the mouse brain. Mouse
        data is from the Allen SDK.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
        With it, we will be able to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            identify brain zones to study (points of interest) - DONE
        </li>
        <li>
            download its data using Allen Brain institute public API - DONE
        </li>
        <li>
            segment images and volumes - TODO
        </li>
        <li>
            analyse the result of our segmentation (fiber crossing) - TODO
        </li>
    </ul>
